          <p> Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! I haven't felt much of anything
            since my guinea pig died. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. One hundred dollars. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy
            you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Ow, my spirit! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN!

          <p>Why would I want to know that? I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Moving along… Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! We're rescuing
            ya. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just
            learn to play this stupid thing. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me
            feel angry! Oh yeah, good luck with that. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

            Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird,"
            and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds!
            Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?
            Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.
            Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.*
            Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.
            Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Fame was like a drug.
            But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!
            I didn't get rich by signing checks.Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!
            I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Donuts.
            Is there anything they can't do? Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark.
